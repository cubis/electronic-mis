There will be a few changes on how we track progress this block. We will talk more about it in class.
  * We will be using code.google.com more
  * Jobs, stories, issues will be posted on "Issues" tab
    * Anyone may sign up for any job, do it, then mark it complete
    * Anyone may code, test, document this block
    * Everyone is required to sign up for at least on "issue"

First order of business, clean up
  * We will be stripping down our project to bare functionality.
  * We will be fixing every test we failed
  * We will be correcting documentation to our customers specifications
  * We will be correcting any functional requirements we did not complete from last itteration.

We kicked ass last block, and what is awesome is that we all know we could still do better :)

### 6/22/2011 ###
I think we can all agree we are doing well. We got a lot done but now we know we still have a lot more to do. Let's take a weekend off to recover, and celebrate. Monday assignments will be redone, and we will hit it full throttle.

### 6/17/2011 ###
We will extend the code freeze until Monday 11:00pm.

This will leave one less day for for preparing our demo. Be ready to
hit it hard on Tuesday. Testing, and security auditing will be run
through that day. We don't expect to pass every case this iteration.
It will leave us something to do next project block.

Another successful code workshop. We got a lot done, we found more we still need to do. The end of the iteration is near and we are starting to see a more and more complete product.

Commit your code after every session, unless told otherwise. If you wait too long, you increase the chance that someone else edits your file and conflict occurs.

### 6/15/2011 ###
Code workshop 2 has been set for this Friday 17th. There will be pizza! Programmers love pizza. session will be 4:30pm to 9:00pm. We would like to have the majority of the application put together and leave only touch up work and testing before the code freeze.

check out this article. Keep these things in mind while programming. Security will be a major factor on our grade.
